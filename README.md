# Predictive Analytics Projects

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of predictive analytics projects. Each project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to build models that forecast future outcomes or make informed predictions based on historical data.

## Projects

### Project 1: Predictive Analytics Project 1 ([`Predictive_Analytics_Project_1.ipynb`](Predictive_Analytics_Project_1.ipynb) / [`predictive_analytics_project_1.py`](predictive_analytics_project_1.py))
* **Description:** This project focuses on [**briefly describe what Project 1 aims to predict or analyze, e.g., "building a regression model to predict a continuous variable," or "developing a classification model for a binary outcome"**]. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
* **Key Techniques:** [e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization]
* **Dataset:** [If applicable, mention the type of dataset used for Project 1, e.g., "a synthetic dataset," "a publicly available dataset on X."]

### Project 2: Predictive Analytics Project 2 ([`Predictive_Analytics_project2.ipynb`](Predictive_Analytics_project2.ipynb) / [`predictive_analytics_project2.py`](predictive_analytics_project2.py))
* **Description:** This project, potentially utilizing the `cars.csv` dataset, aims to [**briefly describe what Project 2 aims to predict, e.g., "predict car prices based on features like mileage, make, and model," or "classify car types based on performance metrics."**]. It showcases [mention specific advanced techniques if used, e.g., "more complex feature engineering" or "comparison of multiple machine learning models"].
* **Key Techniques:** [e.g., Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Data Scaling, Model Hyperparameter Tuning]
* **Dataset:** `cars.csv` (included in the repository)

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and model development.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model implementation (e.g., regression, classification).
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Other Libraries:** [Add any other specific libraries you used, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras if for deep learning]

## How to Run the Projects
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sreelakshmi-rv/Predictive_Analytics_Projects.git](https://github.com/Sreelakshmi-rv/Predictive_Analytics_Projects.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Predictive_Analytics_Projects
    ```
3.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
    (Adjust this command if you used other specific libraries like TensorFlow or Keras.)
4.  **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  From the Jupyter interface, open and run the `.ipynb` files for Project 1 and Project 2.
